# Linked List
## Description
A linked list data structure with all the basic methods. [The project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists) is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)'s curriculum. The Odin Project provides a high quality web development education maintained by an open source community.
## Live Preview
Use the [linked list](https://haminimi.github.io/linked-list/) in your developer console.
## Methods
- **append:** adds a new node containing value to the end of the list
- **prepend:** adds a new node containing value to the start of the list
- **size:** returns the total number of nodes in the list
- **returnHead:** returns the first node in the list
- **returnTail:** returns the last node in the list
- **at:** returns the node at the given index
- **pop:** removes the last element from the list
- **contains:** returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false
- **find:** returns the index of the node containing value, or null if not found
- **toString:** represents your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console, the format is: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null
- **insertAt:** inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index
- **removeAt:** removes the node at the given index

**To Do:**
- [ ] **Try to improve and optimize the methods**
